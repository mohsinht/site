## <i className="resume-icon fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i> PERSONAL STATEMENT
##### BACKGROUND
I started programming in 2014 out of curiosity — building websites as a hobby, then turning that passion into a profession. By 2016, I was working with international clients as a freelancer, consistently earning top-rated status for delivering high-quality full-stack solutions. I began with WordPress, but quickly transitioned to modern stacks like Node.js and TypeScript, driven by a love for clean, scalable architecture.

In the last few years, I’ve focused on building **healthtech infrastructure** at scale — owning backend systems, designing APIs, and contributing to open-source at Awell Health, a Series A company focused on clinical automation.
##### OBJECTIVE
I'm passionate about solving complex problems through thoughtful engineering and system design. My goal is to grow into a **Software Architect**, helping shape the foundations of impactful products — especially in mission-driven, high-scale environments.
