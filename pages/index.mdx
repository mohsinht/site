## üëã About Me  
I'm a software engineer with **5+ years of experience** designing, developing, and scaling web applications ‚Äî from backend APIs to responsive frontends. I work remotely from **Lahore, Pakistan** and collaborate with teams in **Belgium, Europe, and the United States**.

My focus is always on building software that's **reliable, scalable, and user-oriented** ‚Äî especially when it involves system design, clean architecture, and developer tooling.

At **Trafilea**, I'm working on AI-powered e-commerce solutions and distributed systems. Previously at **Awell Health** (April 2021 ‚Äì June 2025), I owned core APIs and system architecture used to automate clinical workflows for **100K+ patients/month**. I've implemented **event-driven architectures (CQRS)**, optimized **CI/CD pipelines** (Docker, Kubernetes), and contributed to Awell's open-source projects.

Previously at **Tintash**, I built full-stack systems for multiplayer games and booking platforms. I also shipped 15+ MVPs as a **Top Rated freelancer** on Upwork with 100% client satisfaction.

I'm passionate about clean architecture, developer velocity, and turning complex ideas into reliable software ‚Äî especially with **TypeScript + Node.js**.
