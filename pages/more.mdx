## RECOMMENDATIONS

<div className="recommendations-container">

    <div className="recommendation-item">
        **Awell Health**   
        <small></small>   
       I worked with Mohsin for four years at Awell. Over this time he consistently proved his value as a smart, capable, autonomous and reliable software engineer.
        He particularly impressed me with his ability to intuitively pick sound technical and architectural decisions even when he did not necessarily have first hand experience with the technology involved.

        **Awell Health**   
        <small></small>   
        Mohsin is a thoughtful, diligent, hard-working, and methodical engineer -- a strong "slow thinker" (in a Kahneman/Tversky way). He is happy to jump in and tackle difficult problems, and when he does, he does so with humility and a desire to learn. At Awell, he has been able to contribute to our code base across the stack.

        Mohsin is a great person, a passionate developer and a hard working team member. He is not afraid of taking responsibility in difficult situations and always tries to raise the bar for himself. From a technical perspective he is quite skilled, but his most important skill is the desire to constantly improve.
